# Backprop

## What is this?

Backprop is a vanilla Deep Learning implementation written in C++ 98 and based on Eigen3.

This code serves as a boilerplate for my personal research. It's not documented, but it is written in a comprehensive fashion.

Currently it supports the following layers: Fully-Connected, Activation, Convolutional, and Sampling.

Important note: Backprop does not use biases. This is a personal choice I made based on my own experience with Deep Learning.
